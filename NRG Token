> ‚ö†Ô∏è *The combination of your GitHub account submitting the application and the payment address above will be your unique identifier during the program. Please keep them safe.*
### Overview

Please provide the following:
- A brief description of the project.
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project within the VeChain Ecosystem.
- If relevant, an indication of how you will integrate tools and features (e.g., Sync2/Connex, fee delegation protocols, MTT, etc) to enhance your project. 

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.
Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

### Ecosystem Fit
Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?

Power Ledger - Australia (Tokenizing solar energy in kilowatt hours)
Energy Ledger - USA (Tokenizing barrels of oil)

We will be different because we aim to tokenize all of the energy industries sales in Canada on a central ledger. Our government is has numerous subsities and rebates for commercial producers to replace CO2 emitting devices with renewable alternatives, grants for employees up to 50% of all employment expenses, and loans up to 100% of project material for projects that offset carbon taxes for large CO2 emitting facilities in Canada.
Our industry connections are strong as we are already established as a licensed and insured contractor for developing energy projects. We have federally funded associations which we are already working with.

### Team's experience

https://y.at/üíéüíéüëΩüíéüíé
I am an electrical instrumentation automation technician in Northern Alberta, Canada. I have been a project manager for numerous energy projects throughout Western Canada. I am versed and still new to programming although my industry connections and hardware experience in power distribution and automation equipment is quite good. You can see some projects that I work on through www.fishenergy.ca and my LinkedIn profile below.
I have federal and provincial connections though my industry and community that will assist in developing energy projects and funding as well as assist with building communication networks for blockchain technologies.

## Development Roadmap 

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

We expect to release an ICO as well as develop the exchange app on desktop and mobile by 2021 Q4 - 2022 Q2.
We expect to have several corporate energy and IOT partners available to stake liquidity into projects by 2022 Q1 - 2022 Q2.

Below we provide an <b>example roadmap</b>. For each milestone:

- Please indicate the milestone duration, workload in terms of full-time equivalent (FTE) and cost. 
- Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of details must be high enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
- Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
- Please commit to providing dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
